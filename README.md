# Intro

This repo contains the results from my second attempt to genearte a POC for the following [idea](https://handsome-femur-998.notion.site/TBD-d2425bb47fc1408e90e4ab928590f0bb?pvs=4) using [smol developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer).

To the first attempt can be found [here](https://github.com/ermartinez13/poc-with-smol-v1/tree/main).

# Improving The Prompt

Okay, its round 2! Our target improvements are:

- generate .tsx files
- persist data to local storage
- use keyboard bindings to trigger actions (eg. forms, timer)
- update model properties to avoid ambiguity
- clarify internal state flow of Timer component
- render list items as data rows
